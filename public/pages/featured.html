                    <p>A fitness tracker was a band with sensors that relayed data to your smartphone; a smartwatch, meanwhile was essentially an extension of your smartphone, a wrist-bound display that allowed you to check texts, emails and social media.
                        Over the last few years, however, the two devices have converged. Fitness trackers became more complicated, adopting screens and even the ability to show smartphone notifications, while smartwatches really leaned into the fitness
                        side of things. </p>
                    <p>The main difference between a fitness tracker and a smartwatch is the list of features and smart abilities. A smartwatch is generally going to have all of the same fitness tracking abilities as a fitness tracker and then some; for
                        instance, most smartwatches have heart rate sensors and built-in GPS for more accurate health tracking, along with coaching and specific workout-tracking, which only the most advanced fitness trackers have.</p>
                    <p>Smartwatches have more advanced features, too, like music control and built-in Bluetooth, built-in mics for calls and voice assistant, and NFC for on-the-go payments. They also come in cellular models, which allows them to operate
                        fully independently from a smartphone.</p>

                    <h2 class="headi">Fitbits™</h2>

                    <p>Fitbit is an American digital health and fitness brand, founded in 2007 and known for its eponymous fitness trackers that helped ignite the wearables trend. A Fitbit is a device that people can wear around their wrist to measure their
                        daily steps, heart rate, and more. There are several types of Fitbits, with different features and styles. Fitbit devices combine your basal metabolic rate (BMR)—the rate at which you burn calories at rest to maintain vital body
                        functions (including breathing, blood circulation, and heartbeat)—and your activity data to estimate your calories burned.
                    </p>
                    <p>Control music playing on your nearby phone with certain Fitbit devices. For Fitbit Ionic, Fitbit Sense, and Fitbit Versa series, you can also control music playing from apps on your watch, such as Pandora and Deezer. The Fitbit Sense
                        is also water-resistant up to 50 meters. So not only can the smartwatch detect when you're stressed, you can wear it in the pool if swimming a few laps is how you prefer to unwind.</p>
                    <p>The most affordable smartwatches are all around the $200 mark. The advantage a Fitbit has over a smartwatch is in terms of price, for example the Samsung Galaxy Watch4 at $210, Apple Watch Series 7 at $399. However a Fitbit can cost
                        as little as $150! And so if fitniss is the only goal in mind, A fitbit is a more economical choice.</p>

                    <p>A fitness ring or a smart ring is a wearable electronic device loaded with mobile components like sensors and NFC chips that are used for a variety of applications, mostly tracking daily activities and as a peripheral tool to support
                        mobile devices. This makes smart rings a nifty alternative to smartwatches and fitness bands.</p>
                    <p>Fitness rings offer a better alternative because you can continue to do the activities you enjoy while also wearing the ring that symbolizes love, commitment, devotion, style, or a special memory. Here are just a few of the reasons
                        people are foregoing their metal wedding rings for silicone rings during fitness activities. Designed to track activity, heart rate, and sleep, the ring can be worn 24/7, even in the shower.</p>
                    <p>A fitness Ring can also be a sleep tracker that collects data about your body, activity, and sleep using optical heart-rate monitoring, a common technology in fitness trackers. Made of titanium, the Ring goes on your index, middle,
                        or ring finger.</p>
                    <p>The Bluetooth-enabled ring is built to work with Android and iOS devices using their respective apps and come with the promise of two days battery life.</p>
