                    <p>Gym equipment maintenance, service and repairs are all important aspects of your gym operation. Each piece of commercial fitness equipment is often relatively expensive and, as such, is usually considered a long-term business asset,
                        which you and your club's members need to rely upon. Gym equipment maintenance, service and repairs are all important aspects of your gym operation. Each piece of fitness equipment is often relatively expensive and, as such, is
                        usually considered a long-term investment for your health, which you and all other users within your household need to rely upon.</p>
                    <p>Even your safety is at risk if maintenance is not done properly. Equipment that is not maintained drastically increases the likelihood of injuries. By having a proper maintenance routine, you ensure that your fitness facility is operating
                        safely. Consistent safety checks will also bring any small issues with your machines to attention. Since equipment at fitness facilities receive regular use it is recommended to inspect them at least once a week.</p>
                    <p>If your equipment is well maintained, it's less likely to breakdown, which leads to increased uptime, more working hours for the equipment, fewer repair costs, and therefore increased performance and productivity.</p>

                    <p>To fix treadmill problems associated with slippage, align and tighten the running belt. Belts can slip when there's too much friction or if the belt is over-tightened. To check if the belt is too tight, lift it in the center. There
                        should be a gap of approximately two to three inches. If the belt is too tight, it could cause enough tension that the motor can't turn the belt. This is most likely the cause of your belt not moving if you recently adjusted the
                        belt tension due to slippage.</p>
                    <p>The various components can be replaced, but not all shouldâ€”a new treadmill motor starts at about 500QR and can cost much more. Other parts make repair a more cost-effective option. A new treadbelt costs about 200QR - 300QR, for example,
                        while drive belts only cost from 50QR to 100QR.</p>
                    <p>According to what the manufacturers say, the average life of a treadmill is about 10 years. However, if you take care of your treadmill properly and lubricate the belt regularly, you can make it last longer. Nevertheless, some of the
                        parts might still fail, and it does not mean that you need a new machine. </p>

                    <p>The tension knob on a mini stepper machine is used to adjust the range of motion when exercising. You can turn the knob clockwise to increase the range of motion. Conversely, turn the knob anticlockwise to decrease the range of movements.
                        When you keep adjusting the tension knob, you understand the workout intensity.</p>
                    <p>A light lubrication of the X and Y lead screws should be performed after every week of usage. Use silicone lubricant only. To reach the Z-Axis lead screw, turn the spindle up/down knob to the furthest down position, which exposes the
                        portion of the Z lead screw that requires lubrication. Spray a light coating along the lead screw. Apply 2-3 drops of light oil on the rail and rub in with your fingers. XY jog the bridge back and forth to evenly distribute the
                        oil.

                    <p>Since equipment at fitness facilities receive regular use it is recommended to inspect them at least once a week. Cleaning and lubricating should not be done every day, but at least once every two weeks or at least once a month (depending
                        on the condition of the machines) should be cleaned and lubricated.</p>
                    <p>A lot of machines and equiptments have quite a few parts and require a bit of maintenance. The maintenance steps include cleaning any deck/motor cover, testing the stop button, vacuuming, checking lubrication, testing any belt tension,
                        and tightening all nuts and bolts.</p>
                    <p>With regular use, the average piece of fitness equipment should last between seven and twelve years. However, it may not last that long with excessive use and if it is not properly maintained. It may exceed its lifespan with regular
                        maintenance and if used sparingly.</p>
                    <p>Your home Gym's equipment goes through sustained and often intensive use and therefore regular professional checks will generally prolong the lifespan of the product. Additionally, servicing will help to ensure that you remain compliant
                        with regulatory safety requirements.</p>
