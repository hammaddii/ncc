                    <p>When it comes to clothes to work out in, do you prioritise fashion or comfort? Many of us fall somewhere in the middle. We may splurge on a pair of compression leggings designed to wick sweat and aid recovery, but on top we’re wearing
                        an old, oversized cotton t-shirt. So, does it really matter what you wear in the gym?</p>

                    <p>Wearing appropriate clothing is crucial when you are an avid exerciser. Many sport injuries occur because of the lack of appropriate equipment, including clothes. Whichever activity you are engaged in, you should opt for the clothing
                        for that particular sport, looking for something that provides ample protection against impact, strain, or overheating</p>

                    <p>An intense session at the gym will leave you thankful that you didn’t wear that old cotton top, as cotton absorbs sweat easily and retains moisture, leaving you feeling damp and heavy. You should opt for light, breathable and sweat-wicking
                        fabrics which will draw moisture away from the body, leaving you feeling dry and comfortable. Intelligent fabrics like XT Air, or XT Air ICE will also help to regulate and maintain your body temperature to ensure you can perform
                        at your best, in the ultimate comfort</p>

                    <p>If you exercise in the morning, get up early enough to finish breakfast at least one hour before your workout. Be well fueled going into a workout. Studies suggest that eating or drinking carbohydrates before exercise can improve workout
                        performance and may allow you to work out for a longer time or at a higher intensity. If you don't eat, you might feel sluggish or lightheaded when you exercise.</p>

                    <p>Don't forget to drink fluids. You need adequate fluids before, during and after exercise to help prevent dehydration. Water is generally the best way to replace lost fluids. But if you're exercising for more than 60 minutes, use a
                        sports drink. Sports drinks can help maintain your body's electrolyte balance and give you a bit more energy because they contain carbohydrates.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to eating and exercise, everyone is different. So pay attention to how you feel during your workout and to your overall performance. Let your experience guide you on which pre- and post-exercise eating habits work best
                        for you. Consider keeping a journal to monitor how your body reacts to meals and snacks so that you can adjust your diet for optimal performance.</p>

                    <p>A home gym is a compact unit of equipment designed to allow you to perform many exercises at the one station. These are also called multi-gyms or multis. These workstations are designed to fit into a spare room, basement or garage
                        so that you can do weight training at home. Exercising at home as many advantages.</p>

                    <p>All home gyms need 3 things: Room to train, resistance to train with, and an indoor cardio option. Resistance is usually a barbell, rack, plates, and dumbells, but can be as simple as bands or kettlebells. Indoor cardio includes treadmills,
                        ellipticals, and rowers but even a jump rope can work great.</p>

                    <p>Home gyms are also more convenient than gym memberships because they're right at home, making it a lot easier for you to fit workouts into your day. You're more likely to stick to your fitness plan if you have a home gym because you
                        can't make excuses about not having time to go to the gym.</p>

                    <p>With an at-home gym you can easily exercise without losing momentum when it comes to your fitness goals.</p>

                        to appropriate physical conditioning programs.</p>

                    <p>To create an at-home workout, first choose three to four cardio exercises like jumping jacks, jogging in place, step-ups, mountain climbers, burpees and jumping rope. Then choose three strength training exercises like pushups, planks,
                        abdominal crunches, tricep dips, wall sits, lunges and squats.</p>

                    <p>An activity tracker, also known as a fitness tracker, is a device for monitoring and tracking fitness-related metrics such as distance walked or run, calorie consumption, and in some cases heartbeat.
                    </p>

                    <p>They use a combination of PPG (photoplethysmography) and EKG (electrocardiogram) sensors to measure your blood pressure. The PPG sensors detect your heart rate while the EKG sensors track your blood flow.</p>

                    <p>They use sensors to track your orientation, movement, and rotation. The device collects data and converts it into steps, calories, sleep quality and general activity you perform through the day.</p>

                    <p>They track number of steps taken, heart rate, and also sleep patterns in a few cases. They have connected apps that allow you track your overall progress, set goals as well as offer guidelines to help you achieve your fitness goals.
                        Some of the most common brands of fitness trackers are FitBit, Garmin, Jawbone and the Apple Watch.</p>

                    <p>Yoga is a type of exercise in which you move your body into various positions in order to become more fit or flexible, to improve your breathing, and to relax your mind.</p>

                    <p>Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength, foster harmony in the body, mind, and environment. Yoga professes a complete system of physical, mental, social, and
                        spiritual development.</p>

                    <p>Yoga has the potential to increase fat loss, develop muscle tone, and build flexibility, leading to a more lean-looking physique. If flexibility and balance are what you're after, even the gentlest forms of yoga will do the trick.
                        Many types also help you build muscle strength and endurance.</p>

                    <p>Asana practice is the most obvious way to do yoga every day. Within this category, there are a lot of options. I'm a big proponent of long-term consistent practice. Treat your yoga as a marathon, not a sprint, meaning it's better to
                        go to class twice a week for years than to go every day for a few months and then stop.</p>
